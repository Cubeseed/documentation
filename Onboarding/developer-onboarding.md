# Developer Onboarding

Thanks for joining us as a developer at Cubeseed! If you haven't yet followed the steps in [Getting Started](getting-started.md), please do so before proceeding with the following steps.

## Running the app
* [Frontend Repo](https://github.com/Cubeseed/Frontend)
* [Backend Repo](https://github.com/Cubeseed/Backend/)

## Development Process
* Development is largely team specific. Please speak to your team lead for your teamâ€™s specific process.
* All new features, enhancements, bug fixes must be added as an issue before opening a PR.

## Notes
* At the time of writing this document, the source of truth for implementation is the Figma file.
* Team leads are non-technical, so it is the job of the developers to interpret requirements based on the Figma specs.
